ðŸŽ¯ Thinking back to my time at Texas Instruments as a People Analytics (HR) Intern, I was reminded how powerful data can be in shaping better workplaces. That experience inspired me to build something newâ€”a custom Attrition Risk Dashboard for Netflix, using Power BI, SQL, and some data!

ðŸ’¼ This dashboard analyzes attrition risk across key employee dimensions like education, gender, department, and job level, offering HR leaders an intuitive view of potential retention challenges.

ðŸ§  Behind the scenes:

  ðŸ”¹ Structured and stored data in a SQL database, connected directly to Power BI for real-time updates.
  
  ðŸ”¹Integrated simulated employee survey dataâ€”like job satisfaction, years since last promotion, and performance scoresâ€”to develop a custom attrition algorithm based      on historical patterns.
  
  ðŸ”¹ Developed an algorithm that outputs a dynamic risk percentage, helping prioritize employee engagement efforts with data-backed insights.

ðŸ“Š Building this reminded me why I loved working in HR Analytics: when done right, it doesnâ€™t just describe whatâ€™s happeningâ€”it empowers organizations to act smarter and retain better.

ðŸ’¬ I can build insights like this for your company too! I'm currently open to new opportunitiesâ€”so if you're looking for someone with a passion and experience within People Analytics and data-driven decision-making, feel free to reach out. Iâ€™d love to chat!
